      <description>What a wild ride this semester has been! It&amp;rsquo;s 2:03AM on 1/3/2020. Considering what has happened in the past two hours, everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done seems a bit trivial. But we press on.
I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of arcospy, a python translation of an existing R package. More info here. The TLDR is that I built a python API that allows users to query the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) ARCOS opioid dataset for 2006-2012.</description>

      <description>About me/biosketch In August of 2019 I started the PhD journey at the University of Maryland, College Park. Working under Dr. Kathleen Stewart in the Department of Geographical Sciences, I am hoping to use geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial modelling to understand why some people and places are more affected by disease than others. While some of the relationships between space and health are well-understood, there is much that we do not know!</description>
