      <description>Introduction Slightly shorter blog post this week! More substantial update last week available here. En route to North Carolina to help settle a relative&amp;rsquo;s house. Listening to the audiobook of How To Be An Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi during the drive.
ESDA call Had a ESDA-specific call with Serge this week on 6/12. We discussed how to fine-tune the LOSH function, which is now mostly operational. The function currently offers chi-square inference (demostration of code available here).</description>

      <description>Coding, Progress, Revisions, and More It has been a few weeks since the last GSoC post (5/22/2020). A lot has happened in the United States during this time, and more is sure to come. In the following post I will share my progress on the project and reflect on the challenges faced so far.
More community bonding The plan of hosting calls on Friday has continued without a hitch. On 5/29 we held a PySAL GSoC-wide call to ask general questions that might pertain to all of the projects.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first GSOC blog post! Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020 has been going for a couple weeks now and I thought it would be fun to share what progress has been made so far. If you&amp;rsquo;re just joining now you should know that the first month or so is the &amp;lsquo;Community Bonding Period&amp;rsquo;. During this time the student developers get to know their community, establish expectations, and set recurring check-in meetings.</description>

      <description>What a wild ride this semester has been! It&amp;rsquo;s 2:03AM on 1/3/2020. Considering what has happened in the past two hours, everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done seems a bit trivial. But we press on.
I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of arcospy, a python translation of an existing R package. More info here. The TLDR is that I built a python API that allows users to query the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) ARCOS opioid dataset for 2006-2012.</description>
