      <description>Welcome to my first GSOC blog post! Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020 has been going for a couple weeks now and I thought it would be fun to share what progress has been made so far. If you&amp;rsquo;re just joining now you should know that the first month or so is the &amp;lsquo;Community Bonding Period&amp;rsquo;. During this time the student developers get to know their community, establish expectations, and set recurring check-in meetings.</description>

      <description>What a wild ride this semester has been! It&amp;rsquo;s 2:03AM on 1/3/2020. Considering what has happened in the past two hours, everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done seems a bit trivial. But we press on.
I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of arcospy, a python translation of an existing R package. More info here. The TLDR is that I built a python API that allows users to query the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) ARCOS opioid dataset for 2006-2012.</description>
