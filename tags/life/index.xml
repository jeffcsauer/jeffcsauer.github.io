      <description>Just a short post to announce a milestone in the arcos and arcospy journey! A writeup of the software was accepted at The Journal of Open Source Software. The paper is available online here. This was quite the adventure, and I thought it would be fun to quickly lay out the major moments leading up to this point.
 Summer 2019: I read a Washington Post story about the release of a large portion of the ARCOS database and an accompanying software package to access the data called arcos.</description>

      <description>The end of summer came crashing in and I find myself starting the second year of the PhD program in Geographical Sciences at the University of Maryland, College Park. For the Fall semester I will be focusing on research and teaching. With Dr. Stewart&amp;rsquo;s guidance I have been able to make substantial progress on the first paper of the dissertation, and I hope to circulate the paper among co-authors in the coming weeks.</description>

      <description>A conclusion to Google Summer of Code 2020 A huge thank you to to @sjsrey, @ljwolf, @darribas, @slumnitz, @TaylorOshan, and the larger PySAL group for acting as mentors throughout the summer and welcoming me to the PySAL community. This was a wonderful exercise in developing open-source software and I would highly recommend future students consider contributing to PySAL!
After a summer condensed into ten blog posts we arrive at the finale - one final blog post to mark the end of the program.</description>

      <description>A few brief life updates In a moment typically reserved for &amp;lsquo;As seen on TV ads&amp;hellip;&amp;rsquo;, I knocked over an entire glass of water onto my laptop a few days ago. While the laptop sports one of the new Ryzen 7 8-thread CPUs, the technology remains quite sensitive to water. A nearly-full 8 ounce glass of water came tumbling down on the keyboard. Like most times of brief crisis, I was stunned at what was happening before me.</description>

      <description>Introduction We are rapidly heading towards the final week for the first phase of GSoC 2020! What a wild ride it has been - I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s only been around a month and a half! Brief blog post this week as there is lots to do.
Phase 1 Progress Recap I&amp;rsquo;ve produced solid draft of all of the functions original identified in the proposal, with inference working for nearly all of them.</description>

      <description>Going to keep this update brief as I will be doing a lot more blogging this summer (more on that later)! This semester was incredibly challenging. Probably the hardest semester of work and school I have ever countered. Yet as things in life tend to do, everything came together at the finish line. Class projects, research expectations, and personal goals.
I completed the first stage in the doctoral process at UMD - the Comprehensive Portfolio.</description>

      <description>What a wild ride this semester has been! It&amp;rsquo;s 2:03AM on 1/3/2020. Considering what has happened in the past two hours, everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done seems a bit trivial. But we press on.
I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of arcospy, a python translation of an existing R package. More info here. The TLDR is that I built a python API that allows users to query the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) ARCOS opioid dataset for 2006-2012.</description>
