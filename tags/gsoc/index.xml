      <description>Going to keep this update brief as I will be doing a lot more blogging this summer (more on that later)! This semester was incredibly challenging. Probably the hardest semester of work and school I have ever countered. Yet as things in life tend to do, everything came together at the finish line. Class projects, research expectations, and personal goals.
I completed the first stage in the doctoral process at UMD - the Comprehensive Portfolio.</description>
