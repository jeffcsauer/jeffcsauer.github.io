      <description>Going to keep this update brief as I will be doing a lot more blogging this summer (more on that later)! This semester was incredibly challenging. Probably the hardest semester of work and school I have ever countered. Yet as things in life tend to do, everything came together at the finish line. Class projects, research expectations, and personal goals.
I completed the first stage in the doctoral process at UMD - the Comprehensive Portfolio.</description>

      <description>What a wild ride this semester has been! It&amp;rsquo;s 2:03AM on 1/3/2020. Considering what has happened in the past two hours, everything I&amp;rsquo;ve done seems a bit trivial. But we press on.
I&amp;rsquo;m most proud of arcospy, a python translation of an existing R package. More info here. The TLDR is that I built a python API that allows users to query the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) ARCOS opioid dataset for 2006-2012.</description>
