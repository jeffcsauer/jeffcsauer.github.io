<p>The end of summer came crashing in and I find myself starting the second year of the PhD program in Geographical Sciences at the University of Maryland, College Park. For the Fall semester I will be focusing on research and teaching. With Dr. Stewart&rsquo;s guidance I have been able to make substantial progress on the first paper of the dissertation, and I hope to circulate the paper among co-authors in the coming weeks. A few more rounds of edits to come! Keep an eye out for a preview via the American Association of Geographers Annual Meeting! I have also switched up my teaching responsibilities - I am now a full teaching assistant (20 hours a week) for GEOG330 with Dr. Rachel Berndtson. The course is a high-level overview of western thought on sustainability, touching on everything from the emergence of a unified topic of sustainability through international dealmaking to individual reflections on consumption of goods.</p>

<p>Alongside these tasks is the intent to prepare my dissertation proposal. I cannot get into too much detail now, but suffice to say it feels as though the structure of the dissertation has taken shape. This includes identifying each of the three intended studies of the dissertation, creating a dissertaiton committee, and outlining the importance of each science question. More details on this to come!</p>

<p>On another note entirely, I am pleased to announce a forthcoming short paper in <em>The Journal of Open Source Software</em> (JOSS). This paper is the culmination of efforts that began nearly a year ago in GEOG788P: Models and Methods for Spatial Data Science with Dr. Taylor Oshan. I set out to translate the R <code>arcos</code> package into Python, naming the translated package <code>arcospy</code>. Upon Dr. Oshan&rsquo;s suggestion I created a short writeup of the package, its functionality, and development history for submission to JOSS. The paper will be made available shortly, and you can read the open review process <a href="https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/2450">here</a>. I intend to use ARCOS data as the core basis of the second dissertation paper, so this was a terrific experience in understanding what summarized data is available and how I might use it to save time.</p>

<p>I have a few books I would like to read this semester, in no particular order:
- The Culture of Narcissism: American Life in an Age of Diminishing Expectations
- The Visual Display of Quantitative Information
- The Wreckage of Philosophy: Carlo Michelstaedter and the Limits of Bourgeois Thought
- Health, disease, and society: A critical medical geography (Jones, 1987)
- The Book of Disquiet
- Persuasion and Rhetoric
- Statistical Inference (Casella)
- Statistics for Spatial Data (Cressie, 1993)</p>

<p>In my free time I have been building mechanical keyboards, specifically the corne helidox.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be posting a full blog post later this month about it, but I&rsquo;m loving the hobby so far!</p>
