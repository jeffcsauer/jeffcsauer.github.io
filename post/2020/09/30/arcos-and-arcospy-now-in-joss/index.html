<p>Just a short post to announce a milestone in the <code>arcos</code> and <code>arcospy</code> journey! A writeup of the software was accepted at <em>The Journal of Open Source Software</em>. The paper is available online <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02450">here</a>. This was quite the adventure, and I thought it would be fun to quickly lay out the major moments leading up to this point.</p>

<ul>
<li>Summer 2019: I read a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/dea-pain-pill-database/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> story about the release of a large portion of the ARCOS database and an accompanying software package to access the data called <code>arcos</code>. I mentally bookmark the data knowing that it could be relevant to my future research projects.</li>
<li>September 2019: I start as a PhD student at the University of Maryland College Park, and enroll in Dr. Taylor Oshan&rsquo;s Models and Methods for Spatial Data Science course. As part of the class project I decide to translate the R <code>arcos</code> package to Python. This would be my first large Python endeavor. I get in contact with Mr. Andrew Ba Tran of <em>The Washington Post</em> to get an unofficial blessing for the project.</li>
<li>November 2019: Initial builds of <code>arcospy</code> make it onto PyPI.</li>
<li>December 2019 to April 2020: I work to improve <code>arcospy</code> with documentation, continuous integration testing, and ensuring that all the functions align exactly with <code>arcos</code>. At the suggestion of Dr. Oshan, I prepare a submission to JOSS detailing the cross-functionality of <code>arcos</code> and <code>arcospy</code>.</li>
<li>May 2020: Submit for pre-review at JOSS. Will remain under review until publication in September! Back-and-forth with two excellent reviewers to improve the presentation and functionality of the software.</li>
<li>September 2020: Submission is accepted and goes live on JOSS!</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a great example of a full project lifecycle taking just over a year, even for a relatively straightforward project (not to mention all the time spent by members at <em>The Washington Post</em>). An excellent reminder to enjoy the journey rather than becoming anxious over the end result. <code>arcos</code> and <code>arcospy</code> offer an astounding amount of data and I hope that more researchers have a chance to explore it all in the future.</p>
