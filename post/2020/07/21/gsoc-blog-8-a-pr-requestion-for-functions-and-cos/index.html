<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Two weeks are left in the Phase II of GSOC! It is a bit amazing - and terrifying - when one thinks of how fast this summer passed. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity provided by GSOC and I hope to continue the summer productivity into the Fall semester. But before then, there remains plenty to do in GSOC! This blog post will act as a primary recap for what has happened over the course of Phase II.</p>
<h2 id="summarizing-the-work-in-a-pr">Summarizing the work in a PR</h2>
<p>I recently opened <a href="https://github.com/pysal/esda/pull/139">PR#139</a> on the PySAL ESDA github repository. This PR adds the four new estimator functions as well as two demonstration notebooks. Each function is written in the form of a scikit-learn style estimator. PEP8 formatting has been applied to all of the functions, although a handful of lines are left long due to readability. Regarding the notebooks, each notebook briefly reviews the core math of the statistic and explains how a user might deploy the statistic in a geospatial workflow. The included examples match those found in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=losh.cs"><code>R</code> <code>spdep::LOSH</code> and <code>spdep::LOSH.cs</code></a> as well as the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;lei=ytAVX7L4EYKztAb23K9A&amp;q=local%20indicators%20of%20spatial%20association&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyhYuJqtzqAhWCGc0KHXbuCwgQsKwBKAB6BAgPEAE&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=938">GeoDa Local Join Counts tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>I also wrote some straightforward .py test files that execute successfully <a href="https://github.com/jeffcsauer/esda">on my fork</a>. These new tests follow the lead of the existing tests in the PySAL testing framework, specifically <code>test_moran.py</code> for the LOSH function and <code>test_join_counts.py</code> for the local join count functions.</p>
<p>Now, there are some slight &lsquo;issues&rsquo; (or considerations) that I highlight in the PR. I designate these as slight because the functionality and documentation of the estimators are working, yet there are some considerations that might delay the PR. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local join count functions are currently using the default <code>n_jobs=1</code> to avoid issues fixed in potential <a href="#diff-1fd239570b4623d6ce23f0e268495633L510">merges</a>. Users may enter values other than 1.</li>
<li>One doctest dataset, <code>commpop</code>, appears to have a <a href="https://geodacenter.github.io/data-and-lab/">dead link</a> at the moment. Having trouble loading this as a <code>libpysal.example</code>. Once this dataset is working the doctest can be updated. Currently hosting it on a personal Github link.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="challenge-numba-and-multicore-processes">Challenge: <code>numba</code> and multicore processes</h2>
<p>During a recent GSOC-wide call, Dani pointed out that I had hard-coded the number of jobs (<code>n_jobs</code>) equal to 1. This <code>n_jobs</code> setting is similar to the <code>numba</code> <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/dev/reference/envvars.html#envvar-NUMBA_NUM_THREADS">number of threads</a> argument. Essentially, it tells the <code>_crand()</code> engine how many computer cores to use.</p>
<p>When using <code>n_jobs=1</code> the functions had increased in speed anywhere from 40-60% on average. One would presume that increasing the number of cores would directly improve this speed. Yet when <code>n_jobs</code> was set to <code>-1</code> (use all cores) or a specific number <code>&gt;1</code>, I was experiencing quite perplexing errors regarding the size of input arrays. The specific error messages can be seen <a href="https://github.com/jeffcsauer/GSOC2020/blob/master/validation/Validation_LJC_univariate.ipynb">here</a> under the &lsquo;Next steps&rsquo; header. Levi explained that &lsquo;the issue (I think) is when unequally-sized jobs are sent around [to several cores], <code>hstack</code> can fail. Not sure why/how. I think using <code>row_stack</code> solved the similar issue I was seeing in the end.&rsquo; What is quite interesting about the switch of these functions is <code>row_stack</code> has the same requirement that the input arrays must be of the same dimensions (see <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/numpy-ma-row_stack-in-python/">Code #2 example here</a>, yet <code>row_stack</code> does not create a <code>numba</code> error. This issue is fixed in a draft PR by <a href="https://github.com/pysal/esda/pull/133/commits/68f623c268e29e0ad24236fcc10d88536f9df3bc#diff-1fd239570b4623d6ce23f0e268495633L510">Levi</a>, but for the time being setting <code>n_jobs=1</code> will provide both increased speed and stable functionality to users. Once this issue is fixed users may set <code>n_jobs</code> equal to any number appropriate for their machine.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there remains the possibility that using more cores may not improve speed. There are several reasons as to why this may not be so. <strong>I am not a computer scientist so I cannot provide detailed reasoning - the following are a summary of what I have found via some quick online searches.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>A lay summary of reasons is available <a href="https://www.forbes.com/2009/11/23/google-microsoft-programming-technology-cio-network-multicore-hardware.html#63abb07e6914">here</a>. Not everything in the article applies to the current issue (i.e. <code>numba</code> parallelizes the operations), but considerations like lower clock speeds in individual cores, lack of (shareable) memory, and locked resources might. When I forced the operations to use multiple cores I actually saw a slowdown - this could be time wasted splitting up the job and bringing it back together.</li>
<li>Another potential issue is that of thread switching, visualized <a href="http://www.dabeaz.com/GIL/gilvis/fourthread.html">here</a>. The linked visualizations are prepared by David M. Beazley and are meant to &lsquo;&hellip;[O]bserve how thread switching gets more rapid as the number of CPUs increases. Zoom in to see all sorts of crazy GIL contention.&rsquo; Given that each thread switch can lead to what is called &lsquo;computational overhead&rsquo;, we are wary of the dramatic increases in thread switching as the number of cores increases. Now this may not be the case with the <code>numba</code>-ized functions, but it could be!</li>
<li>More discussion available on this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9183476/how-to-do-the-same-calculations-faster-on-4-core-cpu-4-threads-or-50-threads?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1">S/O post</a>, specifically on the topic of balancing cores versus threads.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="going-further">Going further</h2>
<p>Over the next couple of weeks I will have a meeting with Levi and Serge to discuss the PR and what changes might be made. There is certainly room for improvement on the demonstration <code>DOC</code> notebooks, and there may be some cleanup required in the functions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also started working on the <a href="https://github.com/jeffcsauer/GSOC2020/blob/master/scratch/Issues_Scratch.ipynb">Local Gamma statistic</a> in order to practice open-source contributing outside the scope of GSOC.</p>
<h1 id="gsocto-do">GSOCTo Do</h1>
<ul>
<li>Create some experimental notebooks testing the functions across small and large datasets</li>
