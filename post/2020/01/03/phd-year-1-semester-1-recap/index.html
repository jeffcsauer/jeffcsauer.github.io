<p>What a wild ride this semester has been! It&rsquo;s 2:03AM on 1/3/2020. Considering what has happened in the past two hours, everything I&rsquo;ve done seems a bit trivial. But we press on.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m most proud of <code>arcospy</code>, a python translation of an existing R package. More info <a href="https://pypi.org/project/arcospy/">here</a>. The TLDR is that I built a python API that allows users to query the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) ARCOS opioid dataset for 2006-2012. Most of the heavylifting was carried out by the data investigator team at the Washington Post. Links to the repository and their original stories found <a href="https://github.com/jeffcsauer/arcospy">here</a>. It&rsquo;s pip-installable! Try it out for yourself: <code>pip install arcospy</code></p>

<p>During the 2020 winter term I will be the teaching assitant for GEOG306: Introduction to Quantitative Methods for the Geographic Environmental Sciences. It&rsquo;s an online course with 13 or so students, and the first class went off without too much trouble. Even after a few years of really &lsquo;doing R&rsquo; it is always nice to return to the basics and refresh our skills. I learn so many intuitive, base R tricks that I have forgotten. It makes one feel like a novice - but that&rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing! The feeling keeps us on our toes.</p>

<p>Looking forward to the 2020 Spring term - I may be taking both a machine learning (AOSC647) and bayesian methods course (SURV798B). I&rsquo;m excited as it will be a chance &lsquo;get under the hood&rsquo; of several commonly used machine learning algorithms, as well as a finally spend some dedicated time to understanding bayesian approaches.</p>

<p>Liking the new streamlined site! Simple, efficient, purposeful code.</p>
