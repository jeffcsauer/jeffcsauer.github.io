<p>Going to keep this update brief as I will be doing a lot more blogging this summer (more on that later)! This semester was incredibly challenging. Probably the hardest semester of work and school I have ever countered. Yet as things in life tend to do, everything came together at the finish line. Class projects, research expectations, and personal goals.</p>
<p>I completed the first stage in the doctoral process at UMD - the Comprehensive Portfolio. The comprehensive Portfolio includes an extended personal essay reflecting on your academic background and a (~)20 minute presentation to members of the department.</p>
<p>I also wrapped up several courses that will prove helpful in future endeavors: AOSC647 (Machine Learning in the Earth Sciences), SURV798B (Small Area Estimation), and TLTC798 (University Teaching and Learning). The combined coursework felt overwhelming at times, but in the end I felt that each put me through the gauntlet in a topic I wanted to learn more about. For SURV798B I got to play around with empirical and hierarchical bayesian models, while in AOSC647 I was able to deploy several machine learning algorithms to predict tree species at the pixel level. On top of all of this TLTC798 provided me with a space to reflect on my teaching philosophy.</p>
<p>Lastly, and why I expect to be blogging a bit more this year, my proposal was accepted as one of the many projects for the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4681447949991936">2020 Google Summer of Code</a>. I will be working under the NumFOCUS group to implement several spatial measures to the PySAL library. I&rsquo;m incredibly excited at this opportunity and hope it serves as a gateway to more open source software contributions. I will be posting regular GSoC blog updates that track my progression with the project. These posts will be feature on my Github site. Fingers crossed that all goes well! I feel very fortunate to be embarking on this project.</p>
