<p>In August of 2019 I started the PhD journey at the University of Maryland, College Park. Working under Dr. Kathleen Stewart in the Department of Geographical Sciences, I am hoping to use geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial modelling to understand why some people and places are more affected by disease than others. While some of the relationships between space and health are well-understood, there is much that we do not know!</p>
<p>Before coming to Maryland I studied at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and graduated with an MSc in Epidemiology (2017-2018). I elected for environmental and spatial epidemiology courses, and I carried out my project under Dr. Annabelle Gourlay. The project focused on determining the extent to which disease clustering persisted across spatial scales in an area of traditionally high HIV burden.</p>
<p>I have experience in applied data analysis and technical writing in epidemiology, political science, and GIS. I am comfortable carrying out advanced data analysis in both Python and R, and I have significant experience working in STATA. On the side I am trying to improve my PostgreSQL, PostGIS, and web-development skills.</p>
