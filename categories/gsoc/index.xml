      <description>Welcome to my first GSOC blog post! Google Summer of Code (GSOC) 2020 has been going for a couple weeks now and I thought it would be fun to share what progress has been made so far. If you&amp;rsquo;re just joining now you should know that the first month or so is the &amp;lsquo;Community Bonding Period&amp;rsquo;. During this time the student developers get to know their community, establish expectations, and set recurring check-in meetings.</description>

      <description>Going to keep this update brief as I will be doing a lot more blogging this summer (more on that later)! This semester was incredibly challenging. Probably the hardest semester of work and school I have ever countered. Yet as things in life tend to do, everything came together at the finish line. Class projects, research expectations, and personal goals.
I completed the first stage in the doctoral process at UMD - the Comprehensive Portfolio.</description>
