      <description>In some recent research efforts I was attempting to deploy a specific type of spatial model in R. This spatial model has many names including a cross-regressive model, the spatially-lagged X model, or, more simply, the SLX model. You can spot this model whenever you see the inclusion of a spatial weights matrix on an X variable in the right hand side of the regression equation. For example, take a simple linear regression:</description>

      <description>This post is both a reminder to my future self and an explanatory note to future researchers interested in granular opioid shipment data. Many publications and government agencies (state and federal) use morphine milligram equivalents (aka MME for short) as a measure of &amp;lsquo;opioid volume&amp;rsquo;. This is an essential calculation as there are many types of prescription opioids that come in many shapes (tabs, patches, powders) and sizes (5mg, 10mg, 15mg, etc) and formulations (Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Oxy+acetaminophen, etc).</description>
